# Vagrant

Run a single command — "vagrant up" — and sit back as Vagrant puts together your complete development environment. Say goodbye to the "works on my machine" excuse as Vagrant creates identical development environments for everyone on your team.

If you're curious what benefits Vagrant has to offer, you should also read the <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/why-vagrant/">"Why Vagrant?"</a> page.

## Vagrant box

Instead of building a virtual machine from scratch, which would be a slow and tedious process, Vagrant uses a base image to quickly clone a virtual machine. These base images are known as boxes in Vagrant.

The best place to find boxes is <a href="https://vagrantcloud.com">Vagrant Cloud</a>.

I'm going to use <a href="https://vagrantcloud.com/box-cutter/centos64">CentOS 6.4 (64-bit)</a> as base image.
